# Decentralized Bank DApp

Welcome to my first Web3 project, Decentralized Bank. It is capable to perform normal bank functions:
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Compound Interest (by writing the compound protocol)

This project is planned to be deployed to the Internet Computer (ICP) as some of the files are written using the Motoko language. However, such a deployment required an IC token for performing the cycles. The code ran perfectly on my local environment with the image proof.

In your terminal: 
1. dfx start
2. Open a new split terminal: dfx deploy
3. Inside the new split terminal, please enter the following input: npm start
4. Find the right frontend link and click it.
